The Preferences menu allows you to set options for both the current
editing window, and default values for newly created windows and future
NEdit-ng sessions. Options in the **Preferences** menu itself (not in 
**Preferences &rarr; Default Settings**) take effect immediately and refer to the
current window only. Options in **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings** provide
initial settings for future windows created using the **File &rarr; New** or **File &rarr; Open**
commands; options affecting all windows are also set here.

Preferences set in **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings** are saved in files
that NEdit-ng reads at startup time (see [The NEdit-ng Autoload Files](#the-nedit-ng-autoload-files) below), 
by selecting **Preferences &rarr; Save Defaults**.

## Preferences Menu

  - **Default Settings**  
    Menu of initial settings for future windows. Generally the same as
    the options in the main part of the menu, but apply as defaults for
    future windows created during this NEdit-ng session. These settings
    can be saved using the **Save Defaults** command below, to be loaded
    automatically each time NEdit-ng is started.

  - **Save Defaults**  
    Save the default options as set under Default Settings for future
    NEdit-ng sessions

  - **Statistics Line**  
    Show the full file name, line number, and length of the file being
    edited

  - **Incremental Search Line**  
    Keep the incremental search bar (**Search &rarr; Find Incremental**)
    permanently displayed at the top of the window

  - **Show Line Numbers**  
    Display line numbers to the left of the text

  - **Language Mode**  
    Tells NEdit-ng what language (if any) to assume, for selecting
    language-specific features such as highlight patterns and smart
    indent macros, and setting language specific preferences like word
    delimiters, tab emulation, and auto-indent. See [Programming with
    NEdit-ng](10.md) for more information

  - **Auto Indent**  
    Setting Auto Indent "on" maintains a running indent (pressing the
    <kbd>Return</kbd> key will line up the cursor with the indent level of the
    previous line). If smart indent macros are available for the current
    language mode, smart indent can be selected and NEdit-ng will
    attempt to guess proper language indentation for each new line,
    details at [Auto/Smart Indent](12.md)

  - **Wrap**  
    Choose between two styles of automatic wrapping or none. Auto
    Newline wrap, wraps text at word boundaries when the cursor reaches
    the right margin, by replacing the space or tab at the last word
    boundary with a newline character. Continuous Wrap wraps long lines
    which extend past the right margin. Continuous Wrap mode is
    typically used to produce files where newlines are omitted within
    paragraphs, to make text filling automatic (a kind of poor-man's
    word processor). Text of this style is common on Macs and PCs but is
    not necessarily supported very well under Unix (except in programs
    which deal with e-mail, for which it is often the format of choice)

  - **Wrap Margin**  
    Set margin for Auto Newline Wrap, Continuous Wrap, and Fill
    Paragraph. Lines may, be wrapped at the right margin of the window,
    or the margin can be set at a specific column

  - **Tab Stops**  
    Set the tab distance (number of characters between tab stops) for
    tab characters, and control tab emulation and use of tab characters
    in padding and emulated tabs

  - **Text Font...**  
    Change the font used to display text. See below for more
    information

  - **Highlight Syntax**  
    If NEdit-ng recognizes the language being edited, and highlighting
    patterns are available for that language, use fonts and colors to
    enhance viewing of the file. (See [Syntax Highlighting](13.md) for
    more information.)

  - **Make Backup Copy**  
    On Save, write a backup copy of the file as it existed before the
    Save command with the extension .bck

  - **Incremental Backup**  
    Periodically make a backup copy of the file being edited under the
    name `~filename` (see [Crash Recovery](36.md))

  - **Show Matching (..)**  
    Momentarily highlight matching parenthesis, brackets, and braces, or
    the range between them, when one of these characters is typed, or
    when the insertion cursor is positioned after it. Delimiter only
    highlights the matching delimiter, while Range highlights the whole
    range of text between the matching delimiters
    
    Optionally, the matching can make use of syntax information if
    syntax highlighting is enabled. Alternatively, the matching is
    purely character based. In general, syntax based matching results in
    fewer false matches

  - **Overtype**  
    In overtype mode, new characters entered replace the characters in
    front of the insertion cursor, rather than being inserted before
    them

  - **Read Only**  
    Lock the file against accidental modification. This temporarily
    prevents the file from being modified in this NEdit-ng session. Note
    that this is different from setting the file protection

## Preferences &rarr; Default Settings Menu

Options in **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings** have the same
meaning as those in the top-level Preferences menu, except that they
apply to future NEdit-ng windows and future NEdit-ng sessions if saved
with **Preferences &rarr; Save Defaults**. Additional options which appear in this
menu are:

  - **Language Modes**  
    Define language recognition information (for determining language
    mode from file name or content) and set language specific
    preferences.

  - **Tag Collisions**  
    How to react to multiple tags for the same name. Tags are described
    in [Finding Declarations (ctags)](14.md). In Show All
    mode, all matching tags are displayed in a dialog. In Smart mode, if
    one of the matching tags is in the current window, that tag is
    chosen, without displaying the dialog.

  - **Command Shell...**  
    Set the shell used to run programs from the `shell_command()` macro
    function and from the **Shell** menu. This defaults to the user's login
    shell.

  - **Colors...**  
    Change the colors used to display text. The "Matching (..)" fields
    change the colors that matching parens, brackets and braces are
    flashed when the "Show Matching (..)" option is enabled. Note that
    the foreground colors for plain text, selected text, and matching
    paren flashing only apply when syntax highlighting is disabled. When
    syntax highlighting is enabled, text (even text that appears plain)
    will always be colored according to its highlighting style. (For
    information on changing syntax highlighting styles and matching
    patterns use see [Syntax Highlighting](13.md).)

  - **Customize Menus**  
    Add/remove items from the Shell, Macro, and window background menus
    (see below).

  - **Customize Window Title**  
    Opens a dialog where the information to be displayed in the window's
    title field can be defined and tested. The dialog contains a Help
    button, providing further information about the options available.

  - **Searching**  
    Options for controlling the behavior of **Search &rarr; Find** and **Search &rarr; Replace** commands:
    
      - *Verbose*  
        Presents search results in dialog form, asks before wrapping a
        search back around the beginning (or end) of the file (unless
        Beep On Search Wrap is turned on).

      - *Wrap Around*  
        Search and Replace operations wrap around the beginning (or end)
        of the file.

      - *Beep On Search Wrap*  
        Beep when Search and Replace operations wrap around the
        beginning (or end) of the file (only if Wrap Around is turned
        on).

      - *Keep Dialogs Up*  
        Don't close Replace and Find boxes after searching.

      - *Default Search Style*  
        Initial setting for search type in Find and Replace dialogs.

    Initial setting for the scope in the Replace/Find dialog, when a
    selection exists. It can be either "In Window", "In Selection", or
    "Smart". "Smart" results in "In Window" if the size of the selection
    is smaller than 1 line, and to "In Selection" otherwise.

  - **Syntax Highlighting**  
    Program and configure enhanced text display for new or supported
    languages. (See [Syntax Highlighting](13.md).)

  - **Tabbed Editing**  
    Options for controlling the tabbed interface:
    
      - *Open File in New Tab*  
        Open files in new tabs, else open files in new windows.

      - *Show Tab Bar*  
        Show/Hide the tab bar.

      - *Hide Tab Bar when only one Document is open*

      - *Next/Prev Tabs Across Windows*  
        Suppose there are two windows with three tabs in the first
        window and two tabs in the second window. Enabling this option,
        if you are on the third tab in the first window, hitting Ctrl +
        PageDown would switch to the first tab in the second window
        (instead of switching to the first tab in the first window).

      - *Sort Tabs Alphabetically*

  - **Show Tooltips**  
    Show file name and path in a tooltip when moving the mouse pointer
    over a tab. (See [Tabbed Editing](08.md).)

  - **Terminate with Line Break on Save**  
    Some programs expect text files to end with a newline. If this
    option is activated, NEdit-ng will append one if not already
    present.

  - **Sort Open Prev.**  
    Menu Option to order **File &rarr; Open Previous**
    alphabetically, versus in order of last access.

  - **Popups Under Pointer**  
    Display pop-up dialogs centered on the current mouse position, as
    opposed to centered on the parent window. This generally speeds
    interaction, and is essential for users who set their window
    managers so keyboard focus follows the mouse.

  - **Auto-Scroll Near Window Top/Bottom**  
    When this option is enabled the window will automatically scroll
    when the cursor comes 4 lines from the top or bottom of the window
    (except at the beginning of the file). The number of lines can be
    customized with the `nedit.autoScrollVPadding` setting in the
    config.ini file.

  - **Warnings**  
    Options for controlling the popping up of warning dialogs:
    
      - *File Modified Externally*  
        Pop up a warning dialog when files get changed external to
        NEdit-ng.

      - *Check Modified File Contents*  
        If external file modification warnings are requested, also check
        the file contents iso. only the modification date.

      - *On Exit*  
        Ask before exiting when two or more files are open in an
        NEdit-ng session or before closing a window with two or more
        tabs.

  - **Initial Window Size**  
    Default size for new windows.

## Changing The Display Font

The font used to display text in NEdit-ng is set under **Preferences &rarr; Text Font** 
(for the current window), or **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings Text Font**  (for future windows). 
NEdit-ng shows a list of the monospaced fonts that are available on your system in this dialog.

## Customizing Menus

You can add or change items in the **Shell**, **Macro**, and window background
menus under **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Customize Menus**.
When you choose one of these, you will see a dialog with a list of the
current user-configurable items from the menu on the left. To change an
existing item, select it from the list, and its properties will appear
in the remaining fields of the dialog, where you may change them.
Selecting the item **New** from the list allows you to enter new items in
the menu.

Hopefully most of the characteristics are self explanatory, but here are
a few things to note:

Accelerator keys are keyboard shortcuts which appear on the right hand
side of the menus, and allow you avoid pulling down the menu and
activate the command with a single keystroke. Enter accelerators by
typing the keys exactly as you would to activate the command.

Mnemonics are a single letter which should be part of the menu item
name, which allow users to traverse and activate menu items by typing
keys when the menu is pulled down. These are specified by placing `&`
in the name immediately before the desired letter. For example, `T&est`
will have `e` as its mnemonic.

In the Shell Command field of the Shell Commands dialog, the `%`
character expands to the name (including directory path) of the file in
the window. To include a `%` character in the command, use `%%`.

The Menu Entry field can contain special characters for constructing
hierarchical sub-menus, and for making items which appear only in
certain language modes. The right angle bracket character `>` creates a
sub-menu. The name of the item itself should be the last element of the
path formed from successive sub-menu names joined with `>`. Menu panes
are called in to existence simply by naming them as part of a Menu Entry
name. To put several items in the same sub-menu, repeat the same
hierarchical sequence for each. For example, in the Macro Commands
dialog, two items with menu entries: `a>b>c` and `a>b>d` would create a
single sub menu under the macro menu called `a`, which would contain a
single sub-menu, `b`, holding the actual items, `c` and `d`:

``` 
+---++---++---+
|a >||b >||c  |
+---++---+|d  |
          +---+
```

To qualify a menu entry with a language mode, simply add an at-sign `@`
at the end of the menu command, followed (no space) by a language mode
name. To make a menu item which appears in several language modes,
append additional `@`s and language mode names. For example, an item
with the menu entry:

    Make C Prototypes@C@C++

would appear only in C and C++ language modes, and:

    Make Class Template@C++

would appear only in C++ mode.

Menu items with no qualification appear in all language modes.

If a menu item is followed by the single language qualification `@*`,
that item will appear only if there are no applicable language-specific
items of the same name in the same submenu. For example, if you have the
following three entries in the same menu:

    Make Prototypes@C@C++
    Make Prototypes@Java
    Make Prototypes@*

The first will be available when the language mode is C or C++, the
second when the language mode is Java, and for all other language modes
(including the "Plain" non-language mode). If the entry:

    Make Prototypes

also exists, this will always appear, meaning that the menu will always
have two "Make Prototypes" entries, whatever the language mode.

## The NEdit-ng Autoload Files

At startup time, NEdit-ng automatically reads the following files:

- `config.ini`  
  General configuration  
  Contains saved preferences (menu settings) in the format of a Windows ini file.
- `style.qss`  
  An optional Qt style sheet  
  A Qt style sheet can be used to adjust the appearance of the NEdit-ng application. 
- `theme.xml`  
  A highlighting theme file
  Holds the text drawing styles defined using the **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Syntax Highlighting &rarr; Text Drawing Styles** dialog. 
- `autoload.nm`  
  An optional autoload macro file
  May provide macro commands and definitions for NEdit-ng to execute at startup (NEdit-ng doesn't create this file automatically). 
- `history`
  The history database
  A list of recently opened files, which appear under **File &rarr; Open Previous**.


These files are normally located in `$HOME/.config/nedit-ng` but may be 
elsewhere if the Qt Generic Config Location is different.

## Sharing Customizations with Other NEdit-ng Users

If you have written **Macro** or **Shell** menu commands, highlight patterns, or
smart-indent macros that you want to share with other NEdit-ng users,
you can make a file which they can load into their NEdit-ng environment.

To load such a file, start NEdit-ng with the command:

    nedit-ng -import <file>

In the new NEdit-ng session, verify that the imported patterns or macros
do what you want, then select **Preferences &rarr; Save Defaults**. Saving
incorporates the changes into the NEdit-ng preferences file, so the next
time you run NEdit-ng, you will not have to import the distribution
file.

Loading a customization file is automated, but creating one is not. To
produce a file to be imported by other users, you must make a copy of
your own preferences file, and edit it, by hand, to remove everything
but the few items of interest to the recipient. Leave only the
individual values(s), and within those values, only the particular
macro, pattern, style, etc, that you wish to exchange.

For example, to share a highlighting pattern set, you would include the
patterns, any new styles you added, and language mode information only
if the patterns are intended to support a new language rather than
updating an existing one. For example:

    nedit.highlightPatterns:\
        My Language:1:0{\n\
            Comment:"#":"$"::Comment::\n\
            Loop Header:"^[ \\t]*loop:":::Loop::\n\
        }
    nedit.languageModes: My Language:.my::::::
    nedit.styles: Loop:blue:Bold

Values are in the format of Windows ini files, but the format of text
within multiple-item values like highlight patterns, language modes,
macros, styles, etc., are private to NEdit-ng.

**NOTE:** Future versions of NEdit-ng are expected to change this internal format
to be spit among several YAML files for easier user editing and management.

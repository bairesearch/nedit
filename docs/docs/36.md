If a system crash, network failure, X server crash, or program error
should happen while you are editing a file, you can still recover most
of your work. NEdit-ng maintains a backup file which it updates
periodically (every 8 editing operations or 80 characters typed). This
file has the same name as the file that you are editing, but with the
character `~` (tilde) prefixed to the name. To recover a file after a
crash, simply rename the file to remove the tilde character, replacing
the older version of the file. (Because several of the Unix shells
consider the tilde to be a special character, you may have to prefix the
character with a `\` (backslash) when you move or delete an NEdit-ng
backup file.)

Example, to recover the file called "help.c" on Unix type the command:

    mv ~help.c help.c

A minor caveat, is that if the file you were editing was in MS-DOS
format, the backup file will be in Unix format, and you will need to
open the backup file in NEdit-ng and change the file format back to MS-DOS 
via the **File &rarr; Save As...** dialog (or use the Unix `unix2dos` command
outside of NEdit-ng).

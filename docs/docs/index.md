## Welcome to NEdit-ng!

NEdit-ng is a GUI text editor for programs and plain-text files.
NEdit-ng is a Qt port of the Nirvana Editor (NEdit) version 5.6. It is
intended to be a drop in replacement for nedit in every practical way,
just as on many systems `/usr/bin/vi` is now a symlink to
`/usr/bin/vim`.

Because it is a true port of the original code, it (at least for now)
inherits some (but not all) of the limitations of the original. One such
limitation is that the text display can only handle 8-bit characters so
multi-byte UTF-8 characters appear as multiple glyphs. On the other
hand, some aspects have been improved simply by the fact that it is now
a Qt application.

These help texts are similarly copies of the nedit originals, converted
to be viewable in a browser with some text changes, but there are still
some sections that haven't been fully updated. The Help menu will also
be undergoing some changes to better integrate it with the help texts,
in the meantime please pardon our dust!

NEdit-ng is able to display files in distinct editor windows, or to
display files under tabs in the same editor window. The Options for
controlling the tabbed interface are found under **Preferences &rarr;
Default Settings &rarr; Tabbed Editing** (see also [Preferences](29.md) and
[NEdit-ng Command Line](34.md)).

Notice that you can re-group tabs at any time by detaching and attaching
them, or moving them, to other windows. This can be done using the
**Windows** menu, or using the context menu which pops up when right
clicking on a tab. Within a window you can also drag individual tabs
left or right to rearrange their order on the tab bar (unless 
**Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Tabbed Editing &rarr; Sort Tabs Alphabetically** 
is checked).

You can switch to a tab by simply clicking on it, by selecting it from
the **Windows** menu, or you can use the keyboard. The default key bindings
to switch tabs are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Up</kbd>/<kbd>Page Down</kbd> and <kbd>Alt + Home</kbd>, see
[Keyboard Shortcuts](06.md)) but these can be changed.

NEdit-ng can be customized in many different ways. The most important
user-settable options are presented in the **Preferences** menu, including
all options that users might need to change during an editing session.
Options set in **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings** can
be preserved between sessions by selecting **Preferences &rarr; Save Defaults**, which writes
the changes to the preferences file. See [Preferences](29.md) for more details.

User defined commands can be added to NEdit-ng's Shell, Macro, and
window background menus. Dialogs for creating items in these menus can
be found under **Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Customize Menus**.

For users who depend on NEdit-ng every day and want to tune every
excruciating detail, there are also configuration settings for tuning a
vast number of such details, down to the color of each individual
button. See [Config Entries](30.md) for more information, as
well as a list of selected settings.

The most common reason for customizing your Config Entries for NEdit-ng,
however, is key binding. While limited key binding can be done through
**Preferences &rarr; Default Settings &rarr; Customize Menus**, 
you can really only add keys this way, and each key
must have a corresponding menu item. Any significant changes to key
binding should be made via the Translations resource and menu accelerator resources. 
[Key Binding](31.md) and [Config Entries](30.md) have more information.
